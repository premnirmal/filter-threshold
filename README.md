filter-threshold
================

A simple openCV program using C++, to be used with overhead cameras. The object filters the image to regions with specific threshold values. This program can be used to trace a robot's path. In order to capture the robot, the user must place a small white object on the robot's top - a blank sheet of paper works best.
